# campus-connection-grader
Browser extension for handling grades within the NDUS system

There are three main things this browser extension can do:

1. Download a .csv file from Blackboard with your students' information and "External Grade"
1. Upload a .csv file to Campus Connection with your students' EmplId (or username) and "External Grade"
1. Do both at once: transfer your students' "External Grade" from Blackboard to Campus Connection

Further instructions are at (http://arts-sciences.und.edu/math/faculty/timothy-prescott/ccg/)

This has been tested with the NDUS unified Blackboard available at (https://blackboard.ndus.edu/)

It should also work with the campuses' various vanity urls:

* [Bismarck State](https://www.bismarckstate.online/)
* [Lake Region State](https://online.lrsc.edu/)
* [North Dakota State College of Science](https://online.ndscs.edu/)
* [Williston State](https://online.willistonstate.edu/)
* [Valley City State](https://bb.vcsu.edu/)
* [University of North Dakota](https://blackboard.und.edu/)

It might work with the previous Blackboard instantiations still at

* [North Dakota State](https://bb.ndsu.nodak.edu/)
* [Minot State](https://minotstateu.blackboard.com/)
