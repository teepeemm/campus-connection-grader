To update:

Update version number in user.js
Provide new version to chrome & opera stores

Chrome:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard
app id: difjakgijdlfdbmnfgkloecfikpiecfn
url: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/difjakgijdlfdbmnfgkloecfikpiecfn

Opera:
https://addons.opera.com/en/developer/
app id: neiphapdimjialblhihiiiamefoblppe
url: https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/campus-connection-grader/
but Opera doesn't work, because the file upload widget causes the popup to lose
focus, so the popup closes, and then the upload widget closes


Development extension:
